# A Comprehensive Study of Assortment Optimization with Substitution and Uncertainty: Introducing a Machine Learning Heuristic

Welcome to this Assortment Optimization repository! This project showcases the outcomes of my internship where we focused on solving *assortment optimization* challenges using machine learning (ML) techniques. The primary aim was to enhance retail assortment planning by addressing *assortment-based and stock-out-based substitutions*, while also incorporating *stochastic modeling* for robust decision-making.

## Key Features

- **ML Heuristic for Assortment Optimization:** we've developed an ML-based heuristic that suggests optimized assortments, taking into account potential stock-outs and assortment substitutions. The heuristic leverages ML techniques to maximize performance metrics, like minimizing the runtime (11 days runtime for 200 products using an exact algorithm against 1 hour for 10000 products).

- **Assortment & Stock-Out-Based Substitutions:** This repository presents strategies for efficiently substituting products to prevent stock-outs, thus ensuring customer satisfaction. The code and explanations in the research report illustrate how to implement these strategies within the assortment optimization process.

- **Stochastic Modeling for Robust Solutions:** To enhance the solution's resilience, we've explored the stochastic nature of assortment optimization. This approach introduces adaptability to uncertain demand scenarios, contributing to a more reliable assortment planning strategy.
